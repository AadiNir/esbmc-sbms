    "Description": "Signature replay attacks are possible when a contract does not include a nonce or timestamp in the signed message. This can be exploited by an attacker to replay a signed message to a contract multiple times. This can be used to perform a variety of attacks, such as double spending, or replaying a transaction to a contract that has a side effect, such as transferring funds.",
