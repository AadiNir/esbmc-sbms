    "Description": "The Solidity compiler uses the Keccak-256 hash function to hash the function signature and the types of the arguments to a function. If the function signature and the types of the arguments are the same, the compiler will not detect a collision. This can be exploited to call a function with a different signature than the one intended. This can be used to bypass access control mechanisms, or to call a function with a different meaning than the one intended.",
