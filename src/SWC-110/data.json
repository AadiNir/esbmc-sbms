    "Description": "The assert function is used to test for a condition and to throw an exception if the condition is not met. The assert function should only be used to test for internal errors, and to check invariants. Properly functioning code should never reach a failing assert statement; if this happens there is a bug in the contract which can be fixed by correcting the code. The assert function should never be used to check for invalid user input or contract state, as this can introduce vulnerabilities. The assert function should also not be used for logging, as it will consume all gas in the transaction. Use the require function for these purposes instead.",
